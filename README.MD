# Mod Parts Lister

Welcome to Mod Parts Lister! This tool helps to generate a list of mods and their parts from the GameData folder to the data folder. It also provides functionalities to find specific parts and read crafts to retrieve their parts and the mods used by them.

## How it Works

- **index.js**: This script generates a list of mods and their parts from the GameData folder and stores the data in the "data" folder.
- **find.js**: This script prompts the user to enter a part name and retrieves the name of its path.
- **read.js**: This script reads a craft and retrieves its parts along with the mods used by it. Note that both the `find.js` and `read.js` rely on the data generated by `index.js` stored in the data folder.
